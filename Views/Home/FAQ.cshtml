                        Member data is protected through robust encryption protocols, ensuring that all sensitive information, such as personal details and payment information, is secure. The system also implements role-based access control (RBAC), allowing different levels of access for users based on their roles. Admins have full access to the data, while other users may have limited or no access. Additionally, all data is regularly backed up to prevent loss in the event of a technical failure.

                        Currently, GymMemberships is designed with admin-level access only, meaning only admins can update member information. However, plans for future updates may allow members to access and update their own details, such as contact information, preferences, and password reset, via a secure login. This will be done in a manner that respects the privacy and security of user data.
